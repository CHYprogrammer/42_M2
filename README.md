## Description

The Push swap project is a simple yet highly structured assignment focused on learning data sorting algorithms.
Students have at thier disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.
The goal is to write a C program that calculates and displays the shortest sequence of Push swap instructions needed to sort the given integers.
The learning objective of this project are rigor, proficiency in C, and the application of basic algorithms, with a particular focus on their complexity.


## Instructions

### Benchmark

To validate this project, you must perform certain sorts with a minimal number of oper-
ations:
• For maximum project validation (100%) and eligibility for bonuses, you must:
◦ Sort 100 random numbers in fewer than 700 operations.
◦ Sort 500 random numbers in no more than 5500 operations.
• For minimal project validation (which implies a minimum grade of 80%), you
can succeed with different averages:
◦ 100 numbers in under 1100 operations and 500 numbers in under
8500 operations
◦ 100 numbers in under 700 operations and 500 numbers in under
11500 operations
◦ 100 numbers in under 1300 operations and 500 numbers in under
5500 operations
