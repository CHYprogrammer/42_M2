## Description

 The Push swap project is a simple yet highly structured assignment focused on learning data sorting algorithms.
Students have at thier disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.
The goal is to write a C program that calculates and displays the shortest sequence of Push swap instructions needed to sort the given integers.
The learning objective of this project are rigor, proficiency in C, and the application of basic algorithms, with a particular focus on their complexity.
